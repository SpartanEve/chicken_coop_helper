Chicken Coop Helper
Author: Evelina Johansson, SpartanEve@github

This project was created as an assignment for the course Applied IoT 1DT305 at Linneaus University in Sweden.
The purpose of the course was entetially to learn more about IoT and how it can be used and solve a real life problem.
I choose to create what I call the Chicken Coop Helper, it is a device that will check the climate in the coop so it is not too hot or cold, 
it will also turn on a led-light if it is dark during daytime to help regulate the chicken's sleepingschedule.
