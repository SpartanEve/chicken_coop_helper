Chicken Coop Helper
Author: Evelina Johansson, SpartanEve@github

This project was created as an assignment for the course Applied IoT 1DT305 at Linneaus University in Sweden.
The purpose of the course was entetially to learn more about IoT and how it can be used and solve a real life problem.
I choose to create what I call the Chicken Coop Helper, it is a device that will check the climate in the coop so it is not too hot or cold, 
it will also turn on a led-light if it is dark during daytime to help regulate the chicken's sleepingschedule.

The project requires a microcontroller, photoresistor, DHT11-sensor, some wires, 220ohm resistor, 10Kohm resistor, a LED-light, and a power source to run the microcontroller.
I used a Raspberry Pi Pico W which the code is customized for, I have not tried it with other microcontrollers.

There is room for improvment, a thought I've had is to add a motiondetector that would be on the outside of the coop, that would send a notification to warn about a possible predetor.
